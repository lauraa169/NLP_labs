    "The last bit we need is the huggingface transformers library (here is the documentation [https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index)). Transformers are one of the most influential architectures in handling sequences (not only in language). As we discussed in lectures, they excel at taking into account context (which is the salt-and-pepper of NLP) with mechansisms such as self-attetion, which allows them to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence. If you want to know more, revisit the course material (slides and textbook).\n",

      "This is a very light headed comedy about a wonderful family that has a son called Pecker because he use to Peck at his Food. Pecker loves to take all kinds of pictures of the people in a small suburb of Baltimore, Md., and manages to get the attention of a group of photo art lovers from New York City. Pecker has a cute sister who goes simply nuts over SUGAR and is actually an ADDICT, taking spoonfuls of sugar from a bag. There are scenes of men showing off the lumps in their jockey's with grinding movements and gals doing pretty much the same. It is rather hard to keep your mind out of the gutter with this film, but who cares, it is only a film to give you a few laughs at a simple picture made in 1998.\n",

I mean, it's not titled \"The Jerk 2\"... it's \"The Jerk, Too\", which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same, it actually revolves around a completely different person.<br /><br />Think about it: Virtually no connection to the previous movie, other than character names; a totally different story; different cast; and the fact that it's a partial musical.<br /><br />I say give this movie some credit. It does have plenty of laughs in it.. Mark Blankfield at his prime.\n",

In fact, I think that I enjoyed this movie even more than the first one. I also thought that the cast in this movie was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of Stanley's screenplay Cabin by the Lake- it wasn't a completely redundant film of Stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them. - If you're looking for some deep meaning, then this film is probably not the one for you. However, if you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then go ahead and watch it. I've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film. :)\n",

I should feel ashame, because I paid for this lousy Picture.<br /><br />Hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline :-)\n",

      "This movie was made in 1948, but it still rings true today. Very, very funny. It begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it \"builds\" from there. Anyone who has ever built a house, will find this movie very endearing. Great cast. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's....clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are made to the cost of things, and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely. I am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it. A true classic.\n",

Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale.

    "I first tried adding a feature that calculates the difference between the number of positive and negative words in the review, but this didn't change the accuracy score at all. Probably because that information is already encoded in the number of positive and number of negative words, and adding the difference doesn't add any new information. So the next feature I tried adding was the average word length. This feature increased the accuracy on the validation set. This is likely a useful feature because it can capture the complexity of the language used to describe the movie, which can be an indicator of the review's sentiment. I imagine that people who enjoyed a movie are more likely to put effort into writing a detailed review, however this might not always eb the case since some people are also passionate about writing negative reviews. My next improvement was expanding the positive and negative vocabulary to over double the number of words. I thougt this was most likely the most representative feature in order to determine the sentiment of a review, and I expected it to improve the accuracy score. This change did improve accuracy on both the train set and validation set, but the improvement was not as significant as I expected. Lastly, I extracted the number of words in all caps as a feature, since I thought that this could exprress anger or extreme disappointment. This feature also improved the accuracy score on the train and validation set by a little bit, but not too much. This might be because some people might use all caps to express excitement. The final accuracy on the train set is 0.69115 and on the validation set is 0.6874."

Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale.

      " mr bean starring legendary rowan atkinson was huge hit during its run in 1990s i probably first saw it when i was around ten shortly after it ended so i was seeing reruns i certainly wasnt much of fan at time didnt see too many episodes i didnt really get into show until my late teens just few years ago which was when i finally watched every episode unlike before it made me laugh many times since then that has always been case during repeat viewings of episodes br br mr bean is mysterious self centred antisocial extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is his teddy he is pretty much isolated from society life is not easy for him as he constantly struggles with very simple things this is because he lacks some fairly basic knowledge has mind of child he finds himself in various kinds of trouble wherever he goes comes up with very bizarre ways to try solve problems he faces not only does he often cause trouble for himself sometimes for other people as well which he often doesnt tend to realize in other words mr bean is walking disaster br br humour in this show is very visual there is very little dialogue gags are almost always sight gags which is mostly what show is about while there may be occasional lacklustre gag i would say vast majority of them are funny often hilarious there are so many highlights while mr bean is certainly not most sophisticated comedy ever made its still great for many of those who like visual humour due to very limited dialogue you dont even have to speak fluent english to enjoy show which is why it has received such world wide reputation show ran for few years episodes were made very gradually so only fourteen were made in total nonetheless it is classic series deserves its wide appeal \n",

    "Examine the outputs: The tokenizer returned three things:\n",
    "- `input_ids` - this is a PyTorch tensor ([https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html)) with the indices of our tokens. PyTorch tensors are similar to numpy arrays. They hold data in a multidimensional array or matrix. The difference is that PyTorch tensors can be placed and modified on the GPU which greatly improves the speed of execution.\n",
    "- `token_type_ids` - this tensor holds the information about the index of the sentence. This has to do with the classification objective from the original paper, where two sentences were given and the model had to predict if they are connected. Because we only included a single sentence, we have only zeros here. We will not be concerned with it in this lab.\n",
    "- `attention_mask` - holds the mask that the model will use to determine if the tokens in the `input_ids` are the real tokens or *padding*. Padding is a technique used to ensure that all input sequences have the same length. BERT (like many other NLP models) process data in batches and requires each sequence in a batch to have the same length, so sequences that are shorter than the maximum sequence length in the batch are padded with special tokens. In this case, because we only inputted a single sentence, the mask contains only ones. Later you will see examples where this is not the case."

much of fan at time didnt see too many episodes i didnt really get into show until my late teens just few years ago which was when i finally watched every episode unlike before it made me laugh many times since then that has always been case during repeat viewings of episodes br br mr bean is mysterious self centred antisocial extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is his teddy he is pretty much isolated from society life is not easy for him as he constantly struggles with very simple things this is because he lacks some fairly basic knowledge has mind of child he finds himself in various kinds of trouble wherever he goes comes up with very bizarre ways to try solve problems he faces not only does he often cause trouble for himself sometimes for other people as well which he often doesnt tend to realize in other words mr bean is walking disaster br br humour in this show is very visual there is very little dialogue gags are almost always sight gags which is mostly what show is about while there may be occasional lacklustre gag i would say vast majority of them are funny often hilarious there are so many highlights while mr bean is certainly not most sophisticated comedy ever made its still great for many of those who like visual humour due to very limited dialogue you dont even have to speak fluent english to enjoy show which is why it has received such world wide reputation show ran for few years episodes were made very gradually so only fourteen were made in total nonetheless it is classic series deserves its wide appeal ', 'when i heard film was to be released theme of what it was about i felt very curious when i saw it was biggest deception of my life technically speaking sound is poor you can tell about man dialogs that were remade on studio that are poorly achieved in final mix secondo of all photography is mediocre some part of films show some soldiers with night vision goggles way cinematographer achieves that dark night is by illuminated everything like if they were in actual military base with lights theres no reference used of moonlight my god thir not least most of ac tings are really poor its totally not believable roll of wife of one of soldier her performance its pretty poor br br great disappointing shame of jury who chose to send this movie to represent colombia on oscars ', 'as other reviews have said another of countless number of alien clones this time with great wodge of terminator thrown in add bit of classic sf story who goes there insanely stupid plot device lifted from andromeda strain apparently flashing red lights make rampaging killer droids unable to detect scared people standing three inches away from them br br ok story after sequence of people running around in space ship killing each other we get caption br br 25 years later br br crew of relay station orbiting mars due to be relieved in 48 hours detect ginormous space ship on collision course its siberia ship we saw in opening sequence not good time to have taken everything useful off line on relay station to do some repairs then approaching ship doesnt deviate from its course is broadcasting do not under any circumstances enter this ship warning after lot of shouting at each other crew of relay station patch something together get station out of way just in nick of time ship changes course rams them any way impaling one of crew on stick outy pointy crew impaler thing satellite starts to loose integrity bits de pressurise lots more shouting running about in which only two crew people are sucked out into space backwards why are they always sucked out backwards br br after few keystrokes wheelchair bound techy who is called wheeler only only detectable joke in whole movie deduces that siberia is draining them of all their power they need to go aboard her switch off its engines they all go on board take their helmets off do not enter this ship obviously means get on board ship expose yourself to possibly fatal infectious diseases one team head for main computer room where they find dead frozen guy clutching what looks like american express card turns out to be minidisc other team find some switches amazingly dead bloke turns out to be father of attractive female crew member voted most likely to survive encounter with rampaging alien they switch engines off this means ships reactor will explode spooky point of view shot starts killing people theres some guff about siberia having discovered new ore petential power source worth millions which mean more venal members of crew immediately thrust themselves into danger to get hold of it pov shot returns with whoosh whoosh walking noises on soundtrack unfortunately these give you idea killer is wearing corduroy trousers effect is wasted br br after that its all just running around getting killed in order of ugliness acting ability until only obvious survivors survive along with cute dog which had managed to lead at least two crew members to their deaths just why space hardened veterans wander into jaws of certain death looking for their pets cats dogs has long been mystery of this kind of movie other stupid highlights include everyone forgetting to act falling levels of oxygen until reminded by voice of on board computer not that low levels of oxygen in any way dampen any of impressive fires this load of idiots start if killer droid id so clever it can steer ship in tight curve have another go at ramming relay station why didnt it turn off do not under any circumstances enter this ship warning signal im sure if it was looking for more people to kill then yelling go away was not good way of going about it br br musetta vander is only person who gets to do any acting everyone else just flares their nostrils all time while baring their teeth shouting pointing guns at each other it that sort of script full of exclamation marks only thing that kept me watching till end was hope that script demand she take all her clothes off get wet while not wearing lot unfortunately it didnt one of things wrong with this movie apart from it having more cyan put on screen than in any other movie ever is that there was no
