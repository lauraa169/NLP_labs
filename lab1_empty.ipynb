    "\n",
    "As discussed in the first lectures, tokenization is a fundamental step in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 🧠💬 that transforms raw text into structured data for computational models. In this lab, you will explore different **tokenization techniques** 📝, preprocess text data 🔍, and implement **tokenization pipelines** using popular NLP libraries 🏗️. Next, we explore N-gram language models 📊 as a foundational approach 🧱 to modeling natural language statistically 📈. These models form the conceptual foundation 🧠 of the neural language models 🤖🧠 that we will explore later in the course 🚀📚.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also gain **hands-on experience** with **Hugging Face Datasets 🤗📚**, while assessing the impact of tokenization choices on downstream NLP tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will have a **strong foundation** in tokenization techniques and be able to apply them effectively in **real-world NLP applications**, including implementing a N-gram language modeling pipeline🌍.  \n",

    "\n",
    "If you try hard enough, you will likely get away with cheating (that does not only apply to LMs). Fortunately, our job is not to police, but rather to educate you. So, please consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We assume that you are taking this course to learn something! LMs are not always right (they often fail in silly ways). This course should prepare you to detect when they are wrong!\n",
    "- We don't restrict the use of LMs because we see the value of being helped when coding (esp. in the context of a course like NLP). Based on what we saw last year in your deliverables, it's pretty clear when you \"copy\" some code and then you struggle to interpret the results. This is the essence of this course and of the skills you should try build for yourself: Many people can run fancy models these days but not many people can interpret the results correctly. Try to be the latter ones."

    "Having n-grams as Counters is nice, but for generation and calculating perplexity (coming up next) this would be inefficient. For this reason, we will create a class representing language models that are based on n-grams. You can check a quick guide on Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-oops-concepts/\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we have the counts of n-grams. The main problem is that, for generation, we need the counts of each token in the vocabulary GIVEN the previous (n-1) tokens. If we were to leave the n-gram Counter as is, we would have to iterate over each entry and check if the first (n-1) tokens matches what we have already generated. To mitigate this issue, we will create a dictionary of Counters, where keys will be the tuples with (n-1) n-grams. This allows us to simply retrieve the appropriate counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also start using numpy, which is a very potent and prolific library for matrices and their manipulations. It is highly optimized, so it will make our code run faster. You can check the documentation here https://numpy.org/doc/stable/"

    "### Exercise 10: N-gram Language Model class\n",
    "Fill in the two methods in NgramLanguageModel class:\n",
    " 1. (3p) `build_model()` builds the model, which is a `dictionary` of `Counters`. The keys of this dictionary are the tokens of the n-grams without the last token. The values of the dictionary are separate `Counters` of the final tokens. For example, in case of the tri-grams `(\"at\", \"the\",\"university\")` with count 3 and `(\"at\", \"the\",\"party\")` with count 2, the previous tokens for both is a bi-gram `(\"at\", \"the\")`. The resulting `Counter` for this bi-gram is `{\"university\": 3, \"party\": 2}`.\n",
    " 2. (3p) `get_counts()` returns a numpy array with counts of all vocab tokens given the passed previous tokens. This function operates on the indices of tokens in the vocabulary. The fastest way to get the index of a token is to use the `self.word_to_index` dictionary. It will return the index of the token: `self.word_to_index[token]`."

    "1. as we can see in the output above, the greedy function produces the same output every time given no input. This is expected because it alwasy picks the token with the highest count. The sampling fucntion without smoothing produces different outputs every time but these are nonsensical. The sampling function with smoothing produces different outputs every time and these seem to be longer than the previous function on average. Outputs are just as nonsensical, and increasing the smoothing seems to increase the occurrence of rare words like \"heu\" or \"floydautoconcierge\".\n",

    "2. when adding a starting sequence as an input, the greedy function different outputs every time, however it sometimes falls into patterns and repeats the same outputs like \"why doyou for the best friend\" and \"but when you for the best friend\". The sampling fucntion seems to produce more coherent outputs given an input sequence, at least it seems to stay on topic more often than before, mentioning related words in close succession like \"in body workout fuel\" and \"i am stuck in portland\". Similarly to before, the sampling function with smoothing still produces largely incoherent outputs and seems mor elikely to output rare tokens as the smoothing increases such as \"uop\", \"equinox\" and \"rd\". Surprisingly, the smoothing does not seem to help with coherence of the outputs, and out of all the sequence generations tested the single most coherent sentence was produced by the greedy generator: \"i am so much fun with my favorite people !!!!!\", although we believe this is more due to chance than anything else."
