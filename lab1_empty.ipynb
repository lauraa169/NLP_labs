    "# Lab 1: From Tokens to Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the first lectures, tokenization is a fundamental step in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 🧠💬 that transforms raw text into structured data for computational models. In this lab, you will explore different **tokenization techniques** 📝, preprocess text data 🔍, and implement **tokenization pipelines** using popular NLP libraries 🏗️. Next, we explore N-gram language models 📊 as a foundational approach 🧱 to modeling natural language statistically 📈. These models form the conceptual foundation 🧠 of the neural language models 🤖🧠 that we will explore later in the course 🚀📚.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also gain **hands-on experience** with **Hugging Face Datasets 🤗📚**, while assessing the impact of tokenization choices on downstream NLP tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will have a **strong foundation** in tokenization techniques and be able to apply them effectively in **real-world NLP applications**, including implementing a N-gram language modeling pipeline🌍.  \n",

    "\n",
    "If you try hard enough, you will likely get away with cheating (that does not only apply to LMs). Fortunately, our job is not to police, but rather to educate you. So, please consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We assume that you are taking this course to learn something! LMs are not always right (they often fail in silly ways). This course should prepare you to detect when they are wrong!\n",
    "- We don't restrict the use of LMs because we see the value of being helped when coding (esp. in the context of a course like NLP). Based on what we saw last year in your deliverables, it's pretty clear when you \"copy\" some code and then you struggle to interpret the results. This is the essence of this course and of the skills you should try build for yourself: Many people can run fancy models these days but not many people can interpret the results correctly. Try to be the latter ones."

    "Currently, we have the counts of n-grams. The main problem is that, for generation, we need the counts of each token in the vocabulary GIVEN the previous (n-1) tokens. If we were to leave the n-gram Counter as is, we would have to iterate over each entry and check if the first (n-1) tokens matches what we have already generated. To mitigate this issue, we will create a dictionary of Counters, where keys will be the tuples with (n-1) n-grams. This allows us to simply retrieve the appropriate counter.\n",

    "Fill in the two methods in NgramLanguageModel class:\n",
    " 1. (3p) `build_model()` builds the model, which is a `dictionary` of `Counters`. The keys of this dictionary are the tokens of the n-grams without the last token. The values of the dictionary are separate `Counters` of the final tokens. For example, in case of the tri-grams `(\"at\", \"the\",\"university\")` with count 3 and `(\"at\", \"the\",\"party\")` with count 2, the previous tokens for both is a bi-gram `(\"at\", \"the\")`. The resulting `Counter` for this bi-gram is `{\"university\": 3, \"party\": 2}`.\n",
    " 2. (3p) `get_counts()` returns a numpy array with counts of all vocab tokens given the passed previous tokens. This function operates on the indices of tokens in the vocabulary. The fastest way to get the index of a token is to use the `self.word_to_index` dictionary. It will return the index of the token: `self.word_to_index[token]`."
