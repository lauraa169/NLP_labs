    "# Lab 1: From Tokens to Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the first lectures, tokenization is a fundamental step in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 🧠💬 that transforms raw text into structured data for computational models. In this lab, you will explore different **tokenization techniques** 📝, preprocess text data 🔍, and implement **tokenization pipelines** using popular NLP libraries 🏗️. Next, we explore N-gram language models 📊 as a foundational approach 🧱 to modeling natural language statistically 📈. These models form the conceptual foundation 🧠 of the neural language models 🤖🧠 that we will explore later in the course 🚀📚.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also gain **hands-on experience** with **Hugging Face Datasets 🤗📚**, while assessing the impact of tokenization choices on downstream NLP tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will have a **strong foundation** in tokenization techniques and be able to apply them effectively in **real-world NLP applications**, including implementing a N-gram language modeling pipeline🌍.  \n",

    "### 🎯 **Learning Goals**  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you should be able to:  \n",

    "✅ **Understand the role of tokenization in NLP** 🧠💡  \n",
    "✅ **Explain why tokenization is important** and how it affects text processing 📖🔍  \n",
    "✅ **Implement different tokenization techniques** – Apply **word** 📝, **subword** 🔢, and **character-level** 🔠 tokenization using built-in libraries.  \n",
    "✅ **Use Hugging Face Datasets** 🤗📊 – Load and preprocess text datasets efficiently.  \n",
    "✅ **Evaluate tokenization impact** 📉🔎 – Analyze how different tokenization methods influence model performance. \n",
    "✅ **Identify challenges in tokenization** ❗🔍 – Recognize issues like **out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words**, **ambiguity**, and **multilingual tokenization** 🌍.  \n",
    "✅ **Identify challenges in tokenization** ❗🔍 – Recognize issues like **out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words**, **ambiguity** and **multilingual tokenization** 🌍.  \n",
    "✅ **Build and use N-gram language models** 🧠📊 - Understand how unigrams, bigrams and higher-order n-grams capture context in text, implement efficient N-gram counting with Python and design an object-oriented N-gram Language Model that supports probability lookup and text generation.  \n",
    "✅ **Generate, smooth and evaluate language models** 🚀📉 - Apply different techniques for text generation and compare models with different values of $N$ and advanced techniques such as interpolation or backoff.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you try hard enough, you will likely get away with cheating (that does not only apply to LMs). Fortunately, our job is not to police, but rather to educate you. So, please consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We assume that you are taking this course to learn something! LMs are not always right (they often fail in silly ways). This course should prepare you to detect when they are wrong!\n",
    "- We don't restrict the use of LMs because we see the value of being helped when coding (esp. in the context of a course like NLP). Based on what we saw last year in your deliverables, it's pretty clear when you \"copy\" some code and then you struggle to interpret the results. This is the essence of this course and of the skills you should try build for yourself: Many people can run fancy models these days but not many people can interpret the results correctly. Try to be the latter ones."
